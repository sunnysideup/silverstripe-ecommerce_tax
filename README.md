GST Tax
================

What is it for?

Allows adding  GST / VAT / any aother tax to an order

The concepts you need to know are:

*   when the prices are inclusive, the site needs to have a default country, so that you know for which country the tax is added.
*   in general, prices apply to all products, but using the GSTTaxDecorator you can make buyable (product) specific exceptions.
*   you can add zero or more taxes through modeladmin.
*   the taxes can either apply to one country or to all countries. In the future we may change this so they they can apply to more than one country (e.g. EU) or to specific regions (e.g. US state specific tax).
*   you can either choose for the tax to apply to all buyables, or you can make it an "optional tax".
*   when you have added the GSTTaxDecorator to the buyables you have two additional options:  optional taxes can be added on a per-buyable basis and taxes that apply to all buyables can be removed from individual buyables.
*   taxes also apply to all modifier charges except any GSTTaxModifiers.
*   for both modifiers and buyables you can change the taxable amount by adding a method "portionWithoutTax" (this name of this method in is configurable)
